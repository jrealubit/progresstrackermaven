Java 21.0.2, 
JDK 17.0.9.9,

Background:
Application to record exercise activities. The data is stored on a .CSV file named "ExerciseLog.csv". The list of activities can be viewed in a table under the log menu option. Existing exercises can be changed. All data fields must be filled out to record/edit an activity.

Thoughts:
I wanted to create an application which could store data, but the data could also be used in other applications such as Exel. There are still some changes that I plan to implement to the app, but this version is the first working draft.
